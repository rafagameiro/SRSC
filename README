// Project Overall and How to run it

Only the phase 1 was implemented in this Project
The main classe focused on the security of the IP multicast channels is SMCPSocket class, inside the secureProtocol package
There are two created exception, TamperedMessageException and ReplayingMessageException
There isso also a class called Logger which manages the message log
Inside the secureProtocol package there is another folder called Config which has all the configuration files essential to program
Those are, the keystore, the SMCP.conf file and the MessageLog.conf file

Since the MessageLog.conf file needs to be rewritten it's outside of the generated jar

To run the jar you just need to type the following command

java -jar TP1.jar (name) (ip multicast address) (port)

- name = it's your nickname that the application will use to identify you

- IP multicast address = IP multicast where the chat room is registered 

- port = port where the chat room sends and receives messages
 
The available IP addresses and ports are
224.5.6.7 9000
252.10.20.30 12224
230.100.100.100 6666

To verify is Project jar is signed you can type

jarsigned -verify TP1.jar -keystore signKeystore
